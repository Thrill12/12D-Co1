## Introduction

In  its simplest form, a computer program can be seen as a list of instructions that a computer has to work through in a logical sequence in order to carry out a specific task. The instructions that make up a a program are all stored in **memory** on the computer along with the data that is needed to make the program work.

Programs are created by writing lines of code to carry out algorithms. An algorithm is the steps required to perform a particular task and the programming code contains the actual instructions written in a programming language.

## Constants and Variables

Data is stored either as constants or variables. Constants never change during runtime, whilst a variable can and most likely will change.

Meaningful names for both variables and constants are useful because:

- It makes it easier to find and correct errors in code. This is called **debugging**
- There are many occasions where there are several programmers working on a single project, so having sensible naming conventions makes it easier for everyone to understand
- It will be easier to update the code later on when further versions of the program are created

### Keyword: Pointer - data item that identifies a particular element in a data structure or memory

## Data-types

It will often be useful to create user-defined data types. Programs can get very complex and debugging very time consuming, so programmers have to try and make their code as organised and efficient as possible. For example, it is easier to reuse a block of code rather than have to write it all over again.

Most programmers aim to create 'elegant' code, meaning that it does exactly what it is supposed to do as efficiently as possible. 

Creating user-defined data-types allows us to be more efficient as all the data we would need for a single object, for example a User class, would be stored in a single variable, accessed by User.name for example.
