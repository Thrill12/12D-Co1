## Data Structures

A way of organising and storing data in a computer program to be accessed and modified

Usually have common operators allowing you to access, add, remove and search sort and travel through items.

In the course there are:
- Stack
- Queue
- Graph
- Tree
- Hash table
- Dictionary
- Vector

An abstract data type is a conceptual model of how the data are stored and the operations that can be performed upon them.
The data structure is an implementation of this in a particular programming language.
