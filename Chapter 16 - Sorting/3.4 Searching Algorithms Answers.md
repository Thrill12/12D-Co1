*Note* When dividing to get the middle, some languages truncate the decimal (completely discard it, only use integer part), and some round up - check out which one it is for your language/algorithm.

Formula to work out the number of times the total (137) has to be divided in half in order to get to the result (or no result, if the element we are searching for is not in the list):

## (log2 N + 1), where log2 is log base 2, and N is the total number of elements in the list

*Note* When working with logs, treat them like powers in BIDMAS, as in do them before adding or subtracting or multiplying anything else. In this example, we would not add 1 to 137, instead we would do log2 137 and **then** we add 1.

In this example, log2 137 + 1 = 8.09803208296, which when rounded would give us 8, which is the number of times we would need to divide to find the final result in the worst case scenario.

*Note* In this context, L and F basically mean the number just before the midpoint (L) and the number just afterwards (F)
