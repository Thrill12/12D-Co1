# Bubble Sort

O(n ^ 2)

Works by going through the whole array, swapping each pair of elements to be sorted, and repeating until whole array is sorted.

## Advantages:

- Simple algorithm - only focuses on two items rather than a whole list

- Efficient way to ceck if a list is already in order

- Doesn't use much memory as all sorting is done on original list

## Disadvantages:

- Can be inefficient to sort out a list - long list = lots of comparisons

- Therefore, it is not as suitable for longer lists

- Worst case scenario, comparisons = (n(n - 1))/2, where n = numbers of items - exponential time increase
