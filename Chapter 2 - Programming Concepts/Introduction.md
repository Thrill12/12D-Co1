## Sequencing

Making sure that each line of code is executed in the right order.

## Assignment

Giving a value to a variable or constant.

## Selection

Allows a computer to compare values and then decide what course of action to take - most commonly, these are used in the form of if statements.

### Nested-Selection

Nested selection can be used by creating new selection statements inside other selection statements, allowing much more complicated cases and sequences.

## Iteration

Iteration is the process of repeating code in a controlled manner, for example while or for loops.

There are two types of iteration:

- Definite: Where we know exactly how many times we need to loop - for loops are an example of this.
- Indefinite: Where we don't know how many times we need to loop, so the computer will be checking for a condition we set in order to stop the looping.

Of course, we can set nested loops inside other loops however this isn't always the best course of action - thing can get pretty lengthy!
