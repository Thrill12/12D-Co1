# MAC Addresses

A MAC address is a totally unique 12-digit hex code.

It is hardcoded during the manufacturing stage to every single Network Interface Card (NIC).
From a MAC address you can uniquely identify any device: a printer, mobile phone, router, laptop, tablet, gateway, wheter it's wired or wireless anywhere in the world.
**Eg. 00 - 80 - A3 - BC - 1B - 90**
