## Thin vs Thick

### Thick client
Majority of processing and storage done on client
Very little processing and storage done on server

Pros:
1. More robust and more reliable. This results in greater uptime and availiability of services
2. The preferred solution when you want to run heavy duty / resource hungry software applications
3. Can operated without relying on a constant connection to a central server

Cons:
1. Often more expensive and higher specification client computers required
2. Every client needs its own software installed, this increasesd the effort and time on the part of the network administration team
3. Due to the non-centralised, distrusted nature this method is more prone to integrity issues

### Thin client
Very little processing and storage done on client
Majority of processing and storage done on server

Pros:
1. Software updates can be done once on server and automatically end up on every client
2. Easy to set up and configure, eg. Add new terminals to a network
3. Much more secure as all data is stored in a central place, the server

Cons:
1. Very reliant on the central server. If it goes down most functionality is lost
2. This method is dependent on a very powerful and reliable central server which will be expensive
3. With this method there is a much higher demand on bandwidth
