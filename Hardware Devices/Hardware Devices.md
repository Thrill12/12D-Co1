### DSLR:
- Light enters the camera, then it's directed through RGB filters before hitting or focusing on the sensor. The sensor contains millions of transistors and those store the data for one or more pixels. 
- The photons are converted to electrons and the charge for each pixel is stored, allowing the camera to create a digital file corresponding to the charges of each pixel.

## Barcode Reader:
- Laser shown onto a black and white barcode - black recorded as 0, reflection from white is stored as a one. At the other end, 1s and 0s are decoded to create the digital data they correspond to.

## RFID:
- Powered by electromagnetic signals when close to the reader (passive) or a small battery. A tag is really small, containing data about the item. It contains an antenna, and signals can be transmitted both ways from and to the reader/tag. 
- The reader is able to read the radio waves emitted by the tag which can be active or passive.

## Laser Printer:
- Rotating drum is coated in a special chemical which holds an electrical charge. Laser beam is reflected onto the drum, and where the light hits the drum the charge is discharged, creating the image on the drum. 
- As the drum rotates it picks up toner which is attracted to the charged part of the drum. Paper is passed over the drum and by charging the paper with teh opposite charge to the toner, the toner is attracted to the paper and away from the drum.
- The paper is heat treated to fuse the toner onto the paper.
