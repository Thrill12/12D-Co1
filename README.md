Hey there! This github repo will be a place where you can store code/files for easy access in school. 

You can place code examples here in the different folders on the left (if there isn't already a folder for a topic you want to include, make one).
You can add files here with any extension, and if you go to vscode.dev, then open remote repository, you will be able to open this repo and make changes
    to the repo online and it will save automatically.
