Hey there! This github repo will be a place where you can store code/files for easy access in school. 

You can place code examples here in the different folders on the left (if there isn't already a folder for a topic you want to include, make one).
You can add files here with any extension, and if you go to vscode.dev, then open remote repository, you will be able to open this repo and make changes
    to the repo online and it will save automatically.

https://vscode.dev/

# Important
- Make sure that, if changing someone's files, you keep the old text/code, either by moving the text at the bottom and making it clear it has been edited(also include your name when you edit someone's script/file) or you comment out old code and replace with new code(again, putting in your name when you change something.
- Make sure when adding new files, there isn't already a file doing the same thing.
- Keep organized please - I don't want to do daily cleanup here :(

# Opening repository in VSCode online:

- Go on https://vscode.dev/

- On the left of the screen, click remote repository, and in the box where it asks for URL, place "https://github.com/Thrill12/12D-Co1".

- Click on the first button option

- Sign in with github


## Tutorial on uploading changes:

- Open https://vscode.dev/, and click **Open Remote Repository**. Popup will show up asking you to sign in with GitHub, then if you have been added to the repo, you should have access. If not, ask Andrei to invite you.

- Change your thing. This can be adding new files, changing a little bit of text, etc.

- If in class, shout out if you are going to change anything as if someone else is on the same file, there might be some trickiness trying to fix the merge issues. If any big explosions happen due to this, call either Andrei, Jared, Miss, or Charlie.

- Go on the source control tab on the left (The one that kind of looks like a graph), then in the top left you will see a message box - here, describe what changes you have made. Doesn't have to be in detail, can be just "I added this topic and code for this topic". 

- Click the checkbox above the message box and pray for no explosions. If any explosions occurr, again call Andrei, Jared, Miss, or Charlie.

    
## Notes:

- **PLEASE** make sure that your code either works before you upload it by testing it in **Visual Studio**, or you mark it with [BROKEN] at the start of your file name, before the language indicator at the start, and someone may try to fix it if they stumble upon it.

- **STICK TO THE NAMING CONVENTION** - that is, for folders, you will name them "Chapter [chapterNumber] - [topicName]", and for files start your file name with 3.either Python, C#, or VB, then what you want to name it, and after the name put .py for Python, .cs for C# and .vb for VB.

- PLEASE ADD COMMENTS WHEN YOU CHANGE SOMEONE'S CODE - even if you go over it in person, you have to add comments when changing another person's code, as anyone might read that and need to understand.

- PLEASE ADD **COMMENTS** TO YOUR CODE.

## Any questions ask Andrei.
