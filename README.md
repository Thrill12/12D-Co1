Hey there! This github repo will be a place where you can store code/files for easy access in school. 

You can place code examples here in the different folders on the left (if there isn't already a folder for a topic you want to include, make one).
You can add files here with any extension, and if you go to vscode.dev, then open remote repository, you will be able to open this repo and make changes
    to the repo online and it will save automatically.

https://vscode.dev/

Tutorial on uploading changes:

    1. Change your thing. This can be adding new files, changing a little bit of text, etc.
    2. If in class, shout out if you are going to change anything as if someone else is on the same file, there might be some trickiness trying to fix the merge issues. If any big explosions happen due to this, call either Andrei, Jared, Miss, or Charlie.
    3. Go on the source control tab on the left (The one that kind of looks like a graph), then in the top left you will see a message box - here, describe what changes you have made. Doesn't have to be in detail, can be just "I added this topic and code for this topic". 
    4. Click the checkbox above the message box and pray for no explosions. If any explosions occurr, again call Andrei, Jared, Miss, or Charlie.
    
    Notes:
    PLEASE make sure that your code works before you upload it, or at least note it in the name that it is not working, and someone may try to fix it if they stumble upon it.
    STICK TO THE NAMING CONVENTION - that is, for folders, you will name them "Chapter [chapterNumber] - [insert topic name here]", and for files start your file name with either Python, C#, or VB, then what you want to name it, and after the name put .py for Python, .cs for C# and .vb for VB.

Any questions ask Andrei.
